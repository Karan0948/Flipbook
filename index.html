            <h2>CARDIO</h2>
            <p>
              Cardio is defined as any type of exercise that gets your heart rate up 
			  and keeps it up for a prolonged period of time. Your respiratory system 
			  will start working harder as you begin to breathe faster and more deeply. 
			  Your blood vessels will expand to bring more oxygen to your muscles, and 
			  your body will release natural painkillers (endorphins).

            <h2>DIET</h2>
            <p>
              A healthy diet is essential for good health and nutrition. It protects you 
			  against many chronic noncommunicable diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes 
			  and cancer. Eating a variety of foods and consuming less salt, sugars and 
			  saturated and industrially-produced trans-fats, are essential for healthy diet.
